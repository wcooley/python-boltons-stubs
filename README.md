Contained herein are PEP 561 type stubs for the
[`boltons`](https://pypi.org/project/boltons/) package.

These have mostly been generated using
[`MonkeyType`](https://pypi.org/project/MonkeyType/) and
[`pytest-monkeytype`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-monkeytype/); as such,
they are limited to what is tested by default with the types included in the
tests and to what has been manually created.
